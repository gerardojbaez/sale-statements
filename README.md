# Sales Statements

A payment-agnostic sales records system for your Laravel application. 

Quotes, orders, and invoices are common features and sales records of most billing systems. The goal for this package is to provide an easy and quick starting point, without losing flexibility.

Payments are out of scope for this package.

## Features

- Keep track of orders and invoices
- Keep track of invoice payments with support for multiple payment records per invoice
- Multiple invoices per order
- Print-ready PDFs (thanks to [Sparksuite's Simple HTML Invoice Template](https://github.com/sparksuite/simple-html-invoice-template))
